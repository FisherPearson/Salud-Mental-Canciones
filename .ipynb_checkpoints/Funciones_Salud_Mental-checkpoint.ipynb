       " '[2] In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.',\n",
       " '[3][4] \\nThe concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion;[1] it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.',\n",
       " 'During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.',\n",

       " 'The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.',\n",
       " 'Rock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrude into the overlying rock.',\n",
       " 'Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, blanket the surface.',\n",

       " '[17] Since the Cambrian explosion there have been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions.',\n",
