There's no one I disapprove of more or root for more than myself
I wanted to pretend that it was better, better, better on the phone
I didn't wanna tell you I was jealous, jealous, jealous and alone

So we talk about ourselves in hell

To forget the love we never felt

Oh, we owed jokes that work so well

You never were so sure, was the moment



Don't try to stop us

Don't try to stop us

Don't try to stop us

Get out of the way



Got to get to climb your tree in the light of the living ghost I see

She sees her father in the old man's eyes while secretly he stares at her thighs

Animals on TV singing about something they felt at some point

I didn't wanna tell you I was jealous, jealous, jealous, what's the point?



As I watched the bell with drapes appear

And I don't withclose for fourty years

'cause we hide what we don't wanna hear

As we hide what's real, real, hear



He is coming from a part of hell

Where like Nanbu I don't go down well

He can't tell that when oblivion

It's a ditch strung out, routine as well



Making fools out of the best of us

Making robots of the rest of us

In that sense I tell in America today

There's a crack, just like going out westward

How you said there was nobody else
Then you got up and went to her house

You guys always left me out



I still have the letter you wrote

When you told me that I was the only girl

You'd ever want in your life

I guess my friends were right



Each day goes by and each night, I cry

Somebody saw you with her last night

You gave me your word, ""Don't worry 'bout her""

You might love her now, but you loved me first

Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are

Oh, you swore on every star

How could you be so reckless with my heart?



You check in and out of my heart like a hotel

And she must be perfect, oh well

I hope you both go to hell

Hoy voy a tomar para no pensarte mami

Si voy a dañar mi orgullo va a ser dentro del tatamí

Solo se que te quiero aunque me dañes cual tsunami

Tu historia la conocen Gerardo, Sinhue y el Juani,

mami

Por mencionarte algunos nombres,

Me hace sentir tan pobre, que estés con otros hombres

Hey!

yo les pedí que ni te nombren

Todo el oro que fabrico hoy en día me sabe a cobre

Ay, me hace sentir tan pobre niña

Si las llame por tu nombre esta de más que te lo diga

Y esta de más que me lo pidas ay vida mía

El corazón perdona pero sabes nunca olvida

Me hace sentir como un suicida por no tenerte

Darme siete de tus días para después olvidarme

Ay! hoy solo quiero quemarte,

Quiero quemarme contigo esta noche y pararte tarde

Que llegue otro martes y yo en ayunas

Contigo todo un mar y en ella solo son lagunas

Tu fuiste mi fortuna cada día cada luna

Cuando perdiste el habla paseando por mi cintura

Es pura literatura que me aprendí de tu boca

Por dejar pasar el tiempo te estas volviendo loca

Cuando te toca, te toca y si no me toca

Espero aguantarte un rato en esta vida tan corta

Y dirás que no me importas, hasta la fecha

Si me queman estas ansias por recoger tu cosecha

O darte con una flecha directo al corazón

Para ver si se te ablanda y así un día regresas



Ay! dame mas de ti princesa,

Si dices que estas bien lo demás no me interesa

Dame tiempo para abrir otra cerveza

Para ver si me emborracho y te sales de mi cabeza



Ay! dame mas de ti princesa,

Si dices que estas bien lo demás no me interesa

Dame tiempo para abrir otra cerveza

Para ver si me emborracho y te sales de mi cabeza

We started talkin' 'bout devotion
The kind that goes on eternally

And I tell her I'm in love with her

But, how can I know that I'll always be?



She just said, ""Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now!""

No intention to be mentioning

I don't know nothing but I love her

but it was only a look alike
She was nothing but a vision trick,
Under the warning light.
She was close, 
close enough to be your ghost,

But my chances turned to toast

When I asked her if 

I could call her your name.



I thought I saw you in the rusty hook,

Huddled up in a wicker chair

I wandered over for a closer look 

And kissed who ever was sitting there.

She was close,

And she held me very tightly

Till I asked awfully politely,

please can I call you her name?



And I elongated my lift home, 

yeah I let him go the long way round

I smelt your scent in the seat belt

And kept my short cuts to myself.



I thought I saw you in the parrot's beak

Messing with the smoke alarm

It was too loud for me to hear her speak

And she had a broken arm.

It was close, so close that 

the walls were wet

And she wrote it out in letraset,

no, you can't call me her name!



Tell me wehere's your hiding place,

I'm worried I'll forget your face.

And I've asked everyone

And I'm beggining to think 

I imagined you all along.



I elongated my lift home.

Yeah I let him go the long way round

I smelt your scent on the seat belt,

And kept my short cuts to myself.



I saw your sister in the cornerstone

on the phone to the middle man

When I saw that she was on her own

I thought she might understand

She was close, 

well you couldn't get much closer,

She said: i'm really not supposed to but yes,

You can call me anything you want.

and they'd gone backwards. 



Something in your magnetism 

must have pissed them off, 

forcing them to get an early night. 



I have been searching from 

the bottom to the top, 

for such a sight 

as the one i caught when I saw your... 



Fingers dimmed in the lights 

like your used to being told that you're trouble 

and I spent all night 

stuck on the puzzle 



Nobody I asked 

knew how he came to be the one 

to whom you surrendered 



Any man who wasn't led away 

into the other room 

stood pretending 



But something in your magnetism 

hadn't just made him drop 

whoever's hand it was that he was holding.

I tried to swim to the side, 

but my feet got caught in the middle, 

and I thought I'd seen the light, 

but oh, no. 

I was just stuck on the puzzle. 

Stuck on the puzzle.

El momento para actuar
Nuestra piel deja ver
Aprendí a quererte bien
Es extraño

Sé que puedo darte un poco más

Esta vez

Busquemos el momento



Explosión inicial

Sigue haciéndonos girar

Tu órbita puede más

No me quiero despegar



Es extraño

Sé que puedo darte un poco más

Otra vez

Busquemos el momento



Nunca fuimos dos extraños

Solo quiero darte un poco más

Otra vez está llegando

Busquemos el momento"

All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday
Suddenly

I'm not half the man i used to be

There's a shadow hanging over me

Oh yesterday came suddenly



Why she had to go I don't know

She wouldn't say

I said something wrong

Now I long for yesterday



Yesterday

Love was such an easy game to play

Now I need a place to hide away

Oh I believe in yesterday

There's this image of you and I,
And it goes dancing by,
In the morning and the night time.
There's all these secrets I can't keep,

I give my heart there's that hotel suite,

And you live there so long,

It's kind of strange now you're gone.



I'm not sure if I should

Show you what I've found,

Has it gone for good

Or is it coming back around?

As in you have to make up your mind,

When your losing,

And your fuse is Fireside.



There's all those places we used to go,

And I suspect that you already know,

But that place on memory lane,

You like still looks the same,

But something about its changed.



I'm not sure if I should,

Show you what I've found,

Has it gone for good,

Or is it coming back around?

As in you have to make up your mind,

When your losing,

And your fuse is Fireside.



And I thought I was young,

Forever,

Or maybe I was mistaken,

But I just can't help manage to,

Get through the day without thinking of you lately.



I'm not sure if I should,

Show you what I've found,

Has it gone for good,

Or is it coming back around?

As in you have to make up your mind,

When your losing,

And your fuse is Fireside"
